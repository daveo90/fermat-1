# Dev Teams

## Introduction

All the work done on the Fermat project is done by Teams. We have several teams working in parallel. Most of them are teams of developers, but these are not the only types of teams. We also have teams of graphic designers, 3d artists, video producers, copy writers, publishing, etc.

In this document you will find a list of Fermat developer teams. Feel free to contact their team leaders if you want to join them.

## Organization

The maximun size for a team is 5 people. They should have all the skill sets needed for these kind of projects as a whole.

Fermat teams are organized in a hierarchical way. This helps the task of reviewing changes in source code, since it is expected that a child team changes are pushed to its parent team in order to be reviewed, merged with their own changes and pushed again to the next parent in the hierarchy. At the top the core developers are the only ones merging the combined batches of changes into the bitDubai codebase.

## Team List

* Thunder
* Code Butchers
